### Summary
Students should solve high-quality problems because they should be able to grasp the right direction of learning and acquire concepts while solving problems. Let's rank the questions only with the correct answer rate and expert evaluation. The closer the answer rate was to 0.75, the higher the score was. Duplicated scores were solved by giving additional scores according to expert opinions to measure the ranking. The consensus rate between the completed model and expert opinions is 68%, and the closer the correct answer rate is to 0.75, the better the quality of the problem.

### Introduction
In order to improve the quality of education, it is necessary to receive answers from students and reflect them in the curriculum. The NeurIPS 2020 Education Challenge aims to develop a new method of evaluating the quality of questions to understand and improve students' learning methods. We should give students good math problems when we ask them to solve them. For example, if the calculation is unnecessarily complicated or crude, it is too sarcastic to call it a good math problem. It is necessary to accurately convey what the problem requires and to be able to acquire concepts or reasoning methods while solving the problem. Therefore, in order to properly orient students' learning, we should aim for high-quality problems and avoid low-quality problems. From now on, let's find out what the appropriate criteria are for measuring the quality of math problems in mathematics.

### Discussion
The training was conducted assuming that the correct answer rate for good multiple-choice questions was 75%, and 75% showed that the correct answer rate was relatively high compared to the correct answer rate. However, since it is 68% consistent with the opinions of experts, it can be seen that there are various opinions on whether the problem with a 75% correct answer rate is a good problem. This is because each expert thinks differently about the difficulty and importance of this problem. Therefore, we should additionally consider the difficulty of the problem, the allocation of the problem, and the time it takes for each student to solve the problem. For example, the difficulty level of the problem is difficult, but there should not be a problem with low scores and a problem with high scores while the difficulty level is easy.

### Result
The matching rate is 68 percent.

### Conclusion
Multiple-choice questions can be said to be a good problem to some extent if the correct answer rate is close to 75%. 
The data provided this time can move toward improving the multiple choice problem. It is necessary to accept the opinions of experts and reflect the difficulty and content suitable for the learning level of the students subject to the question. It is also necessary to improve the model that was created this time. The model should be further subdivided to create a more accurate and suitable model. For example, a problem that a student with a high correct answer rate gets wrong is a difficult problem, and a problem that a student with a low correct answer rate gets right is an easy problem.
